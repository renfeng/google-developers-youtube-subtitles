1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,430
Now, it's important to remember that we're
not here to teach you how to

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,950
build a weather app.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,562
It's not even to teach you all the Android
APIs that we use to build it.

4
00:00:08,562 --> 00:00:13,852
It's really about retraining your brain to
start thinking like a mobile developer,

5
00:00:13,852 --> 00:00:18,995
which is really important, because at the
end of this course we're gonna ask you to

6
00:00:18,995 --> 00:00:20,924
build your own final project.

7
00:00:20,924 --> 00:00:26,452
[NOISE].

8
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:30,939
We're expecting you to already be familiar
with object-oriented programming, and

9
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:33,649
to have experience with Java or a similar
language.

10
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:37,570
Personally, I got started with Android
after years of Delphi and C# development.

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,560
As engineers, we're trained to map our
experiences in one language or

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,310
SDK into new ones.

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,620
Looking for patterns and shortcuts we can
get up to speed as quickly as possible.

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,750
But mobile, and Android in particular,

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,220
have some fundamental differences that
mean some of our experience and

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,310
intuition will actually make us worse
mobile engineers.

17
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:02,370
We like to think of Smartphones as
computers that fit into our pockets.

18
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,240
In a way that's true, but the computers
from the 90s,

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,260
like this Powerhouse I was using nearly 20
years ago.

20
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,660
With limited internet connectivity, low
speed CPUs, and

21
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,600
limited RAM, on top of which, they're all
running on batteries.

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,910
As we go through the course,

23
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,990
I'll be returning to each of these key
mobile challenges.

24
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,160
Looking for places where you're
experienced on desktop or

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,420
server, or even other mobile platforms
might lead you in the wrong direction.

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,790
I will also be back to tell you some
stories from the early days of Android.

27
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,560
Stories that describe how the Android
platform has evolved.

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,230
And nowhere is that more readily apparent
than here,

29
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,830
at the Android Lawn sculpture garden.

30
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,620
Join me here, at the very heart of
Android, at the end of this lesson,

31
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,680
to find out how this sculpture garden of
tasty treats,

32
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,590
also tell us the story of Android's
history.

33
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,840
For now, let's get back to building that
weather app.

34
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,790
So, we'll cross to Dan, to take a look at
some mocks.
