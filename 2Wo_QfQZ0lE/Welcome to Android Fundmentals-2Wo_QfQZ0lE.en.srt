1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:03,070
>> Welcome to Android Fundamentals.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,720
Getting started on Android is straightforward.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,210
Simply installing Android Studio and creating a new project is enough to

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,910
have ticked the, hello world, box on your Android resume.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,830
>> But that's not why we're here.

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,650
We're also not here to teach you Java and

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,792
we're not going to walk you through every API in the Android SDK.

8
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:22,390
>> But what we will do is to help you build a real app.

9
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,935
We'll dig into the fundamentals of how Android works.

10
00:00:24,935 --> 00:00:27,210
Its patterns and best practices.

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,580
>> Our course is deeply rooted in code, but this isn't a copy, paste code lab.

12
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,590
We'll teach you the principles you need.

13
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,850
And help you navigate the hundreds of resources like sample code, documentation

14
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,170
and stack overflow that you'll be using in your career as an Android developer.

15
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,610
>> Getting started is easy, but building something great is harder.

16
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,410
Which is why we're here.

17
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,320
>> We'll work right alongside you.

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,310
And by the end of this course,

19
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,530
you'll be able to turn your app vision into reality.

20
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,230
And you'll build it the right way.

21
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,160
So, in that spirit of collaboration, we'll begin by telling you a little bit

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,300
about us, and where you'll be seeing us throughout the course.

23
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,270
Katherine, why don't you get us started.

24
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,770
>> Sure.
