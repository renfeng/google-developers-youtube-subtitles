1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,990
Once you install Android Studio you can open it and check for

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,570
updates before proceeding.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,096
Looks like we have the latest version installed already, so

4
00:00:07,096 --> 00:00:08,191
we can close this dialog.

5
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:11,960
We're going to be setting up a new project using Android Studio version 1.01.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,490
As you follow along, if things look differently on your computer, that's okay.

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,410
It's probably because you're on a newer version of Android Studio.

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,020
For the most up-to-date instructions on how to get started,

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,260
you can always check the instructor notes below.

10
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,240
Now, let's click here to start a new Android Studio project.

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,550
In the project wizard, we set the app name to be Sunshine.

12
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,180
Then we provide a corresponding package name.

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,570
The package name should be globally unique across all packages installed

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,540
on Android.

15
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,900
To avoid conflicts,

16
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,970
use the reverse of the name of the internet domain that you own.

17
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,520
This follows the Java package name conventions.

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,620
We're using the combat example name space for

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,680
our Sunshine app because it's a sample.

20
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,240
But you cannot publish an app on Google Play with that name space.

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,840
Usually leaving the default package name is fine.

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,270
However, this course was originally filmed with a older version of

23
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:03,110
Android Studio where the module name app was included by default.

24
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,950
So, we'll edit the package name here, so

25
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,180
it matches what we had in the older version of Android Studio.

26
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,920
For your code to match the rest of the code in this course,

27
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,960
you should add the dot app as well.

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,800
Next, we choose our project location and then we can hit Next.

29
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,400
Now we need to choose our minimum SDK version.

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,940
In previous versions of Android Studio,

31
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,070
you would also have to select the target SDK.

32
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,230
Now the project wizard automatically sets the target SDK

33
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,590
to the latest version of Android.

34
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,850
Even though it's already selected for

35
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,480
you, it's important to know the distinction between minimum and target SDK.
