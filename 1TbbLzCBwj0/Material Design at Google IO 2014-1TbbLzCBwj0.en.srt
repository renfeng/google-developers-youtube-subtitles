1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,870
Design is essential
in today's world.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,880
It defines your experiences
and your emotions.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,920
So we challenged ourselves to
create a design that was not

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,709
just for Android
phones and tablets.

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,300
We worked together-- Android,
Chrome, and across all

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,950
of Google-- to craft
one consistent vision

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:25,209
for mobile, desktop, and beyond.

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,340
We wanted a design that
was clear and simple,

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,290
and that people would
intuitively understand.

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,709
So we imagined, what
if pixels didn't just

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,020
have color, but also depth?

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,250
What if there was an
intelligent material that

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,850
was as simple as paper but
could transform and change

14
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,380
shape in response to touch?

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,130


16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,450
And this led us to
a way of thinking

17
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,089
that we call material design.

18
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:46,762


19
00:01:46,762 --> 00:01:51,280
[APPLAUSE]

20
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,990
We drew inspiration
from paper and ink.

21
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,670
However, unlike real
paper, our digital material

22
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,520
can expand, reform, and
reshape intelligently.

23
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,050
The material has physical
surfaces and edges

24
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,880
because the human mind is wired
at its most primitive level

25
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,070
to instinctively
understand objects

26
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,560
and their relationships.

27
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,780
Those scenes and
shadows provide meaning

28
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,230
about what you can touch
and how it will move.

29
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,480
In the real world, every small
change in position and depth

30
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,230
creates subtle but
important changes

31
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,510
in lighting and shadows.

32
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,920
So as part of the L preview,
we'll now allow app developers

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,700
to specify an elevation
value for any UI surface,

34
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,310
and the framework will render
it in correct perspective

35
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,892
with virtual light sources
and real time shadows.

36
00:02:43,892 --> 00:02:48,719
[APPLAUSE]

37
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,269
Material design is
beautiful and bold

38
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,620
because clean,
typographical layouts

39
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,258
are simple and
easy to understand.

40
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:58,599
Your content is the focus.

41
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,979
So the L preview will
allow app developers

42
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:04,469
to easily colorize all
framework elements in your app

43
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:06,950
to match the theme
to your brand.

44
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,220
And we're previewing
a new support library

45
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,850
that we call Palette to easily
extract colors from images

46
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:17,020
and really put those vivid
pictures front and center.

47
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,360
We're giving designers familiar
tools like baseline grids

48
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,320
that work across screens.

49
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,720
Grids ensure apps have
a consistent rhythm

50
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,610
and character, and
this will allow

51
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,920
you to start with a
design on a phone,

52
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,810
and logically and easily bring
that same design to tablets

53
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,660
and laptops.

54
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,960
Now, one design doesn't
mean one size fits all.

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,105
Our guidelines allow you to
appropriately adapt the UI,

56
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:46,470
so your users will already
know their way around your app

57
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,049
no matter what
screen they use it

58
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:54,310
on And we've also updated
our system font, Roboto,

59
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,670
so that designers and developers
can use one type face designed

60
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,570
and optimized for every screen,
from your watch to your laptop

61
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,440
to your television.

62
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,779
So now let's talk
about animation.

63
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,880
It's delightful when your
touch is rewarded with motion,

64
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,100
and material
surfaces slide around

65
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,290
with the physics of
card stock, but they

66
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,460
respond to touch with
splashes of virtual ink

67
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,860
that are like ripples in a pond.

68
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,250
As part of the L preview, all of
your application's UI building

69
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,319
blocks have been updated to
include rich, animated touch

70
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,435
feedback.

71
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,810
[APPLAUSE]

72
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,470
And no detail is too small to
bring a smile to your face,

73
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,910
like when the reload button
loops around or the playback

74
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,490
controls can change.

75
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,279
Finally, in the real world,
nothing teleports from one

76
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,995
place to another, and
that's why it's so important

77
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,720
to animate every
change on screen

78
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,089
in a way that makes sense.

79
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,110
In the L preview,
Android developers

80
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,120
will now be able to
create seamless animations

81
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,060
from any screen to any other
between activities, and even

82
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,000
between apps.

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,470
[APPLAUSE]

84
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,969
So you're probably wondering
how this looks like in practice.

85
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:11,760
We're going to give
you a sneak peak at one

86
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,720
of our familiar
Google applications

87
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,005
in the new material design.

88
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:17,890


89
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,010
Here you can see,
step by step, how

90
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:25,869
we update the design--
the typography,

91
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:34,320
the grid changes, and finally,
the surfaces and bold colors.

92
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,630
And a few small changes make
a really big difference.

93
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,230
And you can also
see how easy it is

94
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,474
to take that same design
to different screens.

95
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,910


96
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,420
Now, I've talked
about only a few

97
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,019
of the highlights of
material design and just some

98
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,280
of the APIs that you can try
out in the Android L preview.

99
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,020
But as we all know, people
spend an enormous amount of time

100
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,120
on the web, and
especially the mobile web.

101
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,680
Last year at I/O, we
announced Polymer,

102
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,690
which was a powerful new
UI library for the web.

103
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,330
Today, we're bringing you
all of the material design

104
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,490
capabilities to the
web through Polymer.

105
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,289
As a web developer, you'll
be able to build applications

106
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,750
out of material
design building blocks

107
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,690
with all of the same
surfaces, bold graphics,

108
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,539
and smooth animations
at 60 frames per second.

109
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:33,960


110
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,670
So between the L
preview and Polymer,

111
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:41,150
you can bring the same
rich, fluid material design

112
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,490
to every screen.

113
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,490
And to help you take full
advantage of this framework,

114
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,269
we've also completely
redesigned and created

115
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:53,680
one unified set of style
guidelines for every screen

116
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,480
and for all devices.

117
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,760
These guidelines will help
designers and developers

118
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,059
alike understand best
practices and build

119
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,270
consistent, beautiful
experiences.

120
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,490
We're releasing the first draft
of these guidelines as part

121
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,769
of our preview today
at google.com/design.

122
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,440
[APPLAUSE]

123
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,039
