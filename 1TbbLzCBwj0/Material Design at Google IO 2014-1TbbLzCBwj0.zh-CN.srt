1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,870
Design is essential
in today's world.
设计在当今世界是至关重要的，

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,880
It defines your experiences 
and your emotions.
它决定了你的体验和情感。

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,920
So we challenged ourselves to
create a design that was not
所以我们挑战自我，创建了一个

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,709
just for Android
 phones and tablets.
不仅仅适用于Android手机和平板的设计理念。

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,300
We worked together-- Android,
Chrome, and across all
Android，Chrome 以及谷歌的其他产品部门一起合作

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,950
of Google-- to craft
 one consistent  vision
构建了一个适配移动、桌面

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:25,209
for mobile, desktop, and beyond.
甚至更广泛设备的一致的设计。

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,340
We wanted a design that 
was clear and simple,
我们希望有一种简明的、

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,290
and that people would 
intuitively understand.
人们一目了然的设计。

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,709
So we imagined, what
if pixels didn't just
让我们想象，假如像素不仅仅有颜色

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,020
have color, but also depth?
而且有深度，这会怎样？

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,250
What if there was an
intelligent material that
假如有这么一种智能化的材料

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,850
was as simple as paper but
could transform and change
外观像纸片一样，却能够响应触摸

14
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,380
shape in response to touch?
来变化形状和内容，会怎么样？

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,130


16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,450
And this led us to
a way of thinking
这就将我们引入了一种思维方式

17
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,089
that we call material design.
我们称之为“Material Design”

18
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:46,762


19
00:01:46,762 --> 00:01:51,280
[APPLAUSE]

20
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,990
We drew inspiration
from paper and ink.
我们从纸墨汲取灵感

21
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,670
However, unlike real
paper, our digital material
却不同于真实的纸片，我们的数字材料

22
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,520
can expand, reform, and
reshape intelligently.
可以智能地伸展、重塑、变形。

23
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,050
The material has physical
surfaces and edges
这些材料具有物理的表面和边缘

24
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,880
because the human mind is wired
at its most primitive level
因为人的思维依赖用最原始的方式

25
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,070
to instinctively
understand objects
去本能得了解对象

26
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,560
and their relationships.
与他们之间的关系。

27
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,780
Those scenes and
shadows provide meaning
这些情景和阴影为人们提供了

28
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,230
about what you can touch
and how it will move.
操作的指引以及这些对象的运动方式。

29
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,480
In the real world, every small
change in position and depth
在现实世界中，位置和深度的每一次小调整

30
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,230
creates subtle but
important changes
都会对光影产生微妙但重要的改变。

31
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,510
in lighting and shadows.

32
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,920
So as part of the L preview,
we'll now allow app developers
作为L预览版的一部分，我们允许开发者

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,700
to specify an elevation
value for any UI surface,
指定任意UI表面的高度

34
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,310
and the framework will render
it in correct perspective
之后系统框架会应用虚拟光源和实时阴影

35
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,892
with virtual light sources
and real time shadows.
以正确的透视角度来呈现他们。

36
00:02:43,892 --> 00:02:48,719
[APPLAUSE]

37
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,269
Material design is
beautiful and bold
Material design既华丽又大胆

38
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,620
because clean,
typographical layouts
因其简洁的、类似印刷品的布局

39
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,258
are simple and
easy to understand.
非常容易被用户理解。

40
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:58,599
Your content is the focus.
你的内容会很自然得成为焦点。

41
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,979
So the L preview will
allow app developers
L预览版让开发者

42
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:04,469
to easily colorize all
framework elements in your app
轻松地为所有框架元素上色

43
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:06,950
to match the theme
to your brand.
将应用程序的主题与你的品牌相匹配

44
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,220
And we're previewing
a new support library
我们正在测试一个新的、称之为“调色板”的支持库

45
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,850
that we call Palette to easily
extract colors from image
可以轻松的从图像中提取颜色

46
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:17,020
and really put those vivid
pictures front and center.
将生动详实的图片置于屏幕中最重要的地位。

47
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,360
We're giving designers familiar
tools like baseline grids
现在提供设计师们熟悉的基线与网格工具

48
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,320
that work across screens.
来划分和规划屏幕的内容。

49
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,720
Grids ensure apps have
a consistent rhythm
网格使应用具有一致的特征

50
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,610
and character, and
this will allow
这将允许

51
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,920
you to start with a
design on a phone,
设计师轻松地将手机上的设计

52
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,810
and logically and easily bring
that same design to tablets
带到平板和桌面上。

53
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,660
and laptops.

54
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,960
Now, one design doesn't
mean one size fits all.
不过，这并不意味着一个不变的设计将应用于所有场合，

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,105
Our guidelines allow you to
appropriately adapt the UI,
我们的设计指南将会允许你将UI调整到最恰当的形式

56
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:46,470
so your users will already
know their way around your app
这样你的用户很容易学会如何使用你的应用

57
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,049
no matter what
screen they use it on
不管他们用哪种屏幕

58
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:54,310
And we've also updated
our system font, Roboto,
我们也更新了系统字体Roboto

59
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,670
so that designers and developers
can use one type face designed
现在设计师和开发者可以在任何屏幕上

60
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,570
and optimized for every screen,
from your watch to your laptop
使用重新设计和优化的字体，从手表到桌面

61
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,440
to your television.
甚至电视机。

62
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,779
So now let's talk
about animation.
让我们来谈谈动画效果。

63
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,880
It's delightful when your
touch is rewarded with motion,
当用材料表面的移动来响应你的触摸，

64
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,100
and material
surfaces slide around
是多么令人愉悦啊。

65
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,290
with the physics of
card stock, but they
看起来像真实的一堆纸片，

66
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,460
respond to touch with
splashes of virtual ink
但它们却能通过虚拟墨水的扩散响应触摸，

67
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,860
that are like ripples in a pond.
就像池塘里泛起的涟漪。

68
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,250
As part of the L preview, all of
your application's UI building
作为L预览版的一部分，你的应用程序的UI模块

69
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,319
blocks have been updated to
include rich, animated touch
已经被丰富生动的动画触摸反馈代替。

70
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,435
feedback.

71
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,810
[APPLAUSE]

72
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,470
And no detail is too small to
bring a smile to your face,
越多的设计细节，越多的感动

73
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,910
like when the reload button
loops around or the playback
比如环绕的刷新按钮、

74
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,490
controls can change.
变化的返回键……

75
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,279
Finally, in the real world,
nothing teleports from one
最后，在现实世界中，没有什么可以远距离传送

76
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,995
place to another, and
that's why it's so important
这就是为什么屏幕上的每一个变化

77
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,720
to animate every
change on screen
都要靠动画来呈现

78
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,089
in a way that makes sense.
我们认为这很有意义。

79
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,110
In the L preview,
Android developers
在L预览版中，Android 开发者

80
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,120
will now be able to
create seamless animations

81
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,060
from any screen to any other

82
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,000
between apps.
甚至在不同的应用之间。

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,470
[APPLAUSE]

84
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,969
So you're probably wondering
how this looks like in practice.
所以你一定想看一看这一设计理念具体是怎样实践的

85
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:11,760
We're going to give
you a sneak peak at one

Here you can see,
step by step, how

90
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:25,869
we update the design--
the typography,

91
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:34,320
the grid changes, and finally,
the surfaces and bold colors.
调整格局，最后，改变表面形态和大胆的用色。

out in the Android L preview.
和一些你能在L预览版中使用的API

99
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,020
But as we all know, people
spend an enormous amount of time
但是我们都知道，人们花费大量时间

100
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,120
on the web, and
especially the mobile web.
在互联网上，尤其是移动互联网。

101
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,680
Last year at I/O, we
announced Polymer,

109
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:33,960


110
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,670
So between the L
preview and Polymer,
