1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,742

2
00:00:02,742 --> 00:00:03,825
SPEAKER 1: Hello everyone.

3
00:00:03,825 --> 00:00:04,385
SPEAKER 2: Hi.

4
00:00:04,385 --> 00:00:06,509
SPEAKER 3: Today's episode
is all about good times.

5
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:08,840
SPEAKER 4: First thing,
you need a Google account.

6
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,625
If you don't have one,
that's easy to fix.

7
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,140
SPEAKER 5: Doing
so will reward you

8
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,640
with a plethora of colors
and bars on your device.

9
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,995
SPEAKER 3: Engaging users
in an immersive, enjoyable

10
00:00:16,995 --> 00:00:17,495
experience.

11
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:19,970
SPEAKER 2: To help you make
your graphics look their best.

12
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,520
SPEAKER 6: That
kind of intelligence

13
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,954
will be built
inside the software.

14
00:00:22,954 --> 00:00:24,370
SPEAKER 7: Our
team here at Google

15
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,790
works closely with
app developers.

16
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,267
SPEAKER 8: What
kind of challenges

17
00:00:27,267 --> 00:00:29,100
do you see developers
facing and what are we

18
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,475
doing to make
their lives easier?

19
00:00:30,475 --> 00:00:32,634
SPEAKER 9: Great apps
engage all learners.

20
00:00:32,634 --> 00:00:34,300
And so we did a very
simple web app that

21
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,642
lets you type in your address
and the age of your kid,

22
00:00:36,642 --> 00:00:38,100
and it would tell
you which schools

23
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,205
you were eligible to attend.

24
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,163
SPEAKER 10: So you can
think of today's episode

25
00:00:41,163 --> 00:00:42,550
as a little bit of extra credit.

26
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,462
SPEAKER 2: So how
does this help you?

27
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:45,670
SPEAKER 4: Let's take a look.

28
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,400
SPEAKER 3: Look.

29
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,460
That dinner reservation
is on my Google calendar

30
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,210
so I don't forget.

31
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,140
SPEAKER 11: These are things
that you can worry less about.

32
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,200
SPEAKER 9: But with a
fundamental understanding

33
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,975
of how the digital world works.

34
00:00:55,975 --> 00:00:57,530
SPEAKER 3: Highlighting
what matters most to users.

35
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,270
SPEAKER 10: But I want to
show you something here.

36
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,728
SPEAKER 4: What if
I told you I was

37
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,520
going to do it without using a
database or a back-end server?

38
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,019
SPEAKER 8: Sounds
like a lot of fun.

39
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:06,946
SPEAKER 10: Whoa.

40
00:01:06,946 --> 00:01:09,036
SPEAKER 5: This is the
type of technical minutia

41
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:09,910
that's worth knowing.

42
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,830
SPEAKER 9: They've
never before realized

43
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,870
how important geeks are.

44
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,254
SPEAKER 8: One billion active.

45
00:01:16,254 --> 00:01:16,920
SPEAKER 11: Yes.

46
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,660
SPEAKER 9: And you'll end up
with a community of people

47
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,557
that you really enjoy
and feeling really

48
00:01:20,557 --> 00:01:22,640
good about the work that
you guys can do together.

49
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,389
SPEAKER 3: Well, these
are just some ideas

50
00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:26,980
of how to take good experiences
and making them great.

51
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,785
SPEAKER 4: So now we're done.

52
00:01:28,785 --> 00:01:31,600
SPEAKER 5: Don't forget to join
our Google+ community as well.

53
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,175
SPEAKER 6: And make
software more intelligent.

54
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:34,960
SPEAKER 3: And Google
takes care of the rest.

55
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,251
SPEAKER 4: Thanks for watching.

56
00:01:36,251 --> 00:01:39,950
SPEAKER 3: Hope we get an
opportunity to serve you again.

57
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:53,499
