1
00:00:01,927 --> 00:00:04,899


2
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:06,773
DAVID SINGLETON: We're
right at the beginning

3
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:10,223
in a new phase in the
miniaturization of technology,

4
00:00:10,223 --> 00:00:12,333
which means that it's
finally possible to make

5
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:15,713
a powerful computer small
enough to wear comfortably

6
00:00:15,713 --> 00:00:18,093
on your body all day long.

7
00:00:18,093 --> 00:00:21,473
And there's a huge opportunity
to bring rich user experiences

8
00:00:21,473 --> 00:00:23,092
to these devices.

9
00:00:23,093 --> 00:00:26,713
And that's why we're building
Androidwear as our platform

10
00:00:26,713 --> 00:00:29,583
for wearables based on Android.

11
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:32,322
Androidwear makes it
easy for developers

12
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:35,763
to reach users on this
new form factor using

13
00:00:35,763 --> 00:00:38,212
precisely the same
tools we're already

14
00:00:38,213 --> 00:00:40,636
familiar with on Android
phones and tablets.

15
00:00:40,636 --> 00:00:43,342


16
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:46,433
People will be wearing these
small, powerful devices,

17
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:48,322
so style is important.

18
00:00:48,323 --> 00:00:50,073
And that's why
Androidwear supports

19
00:00:50,073 --> 00:00:53,723
both square and
circular screens.

20
00:00:53,723 --> 00:00:55,902
And we think that there
will be a wide variety

21
00:00:55,903 --> 00:00:58,263
of fashionable designs.

22
00:00:58,263 --> 00:01:01,822
Sensors will help them
understand your context.

23
00:01:01,823 --> 00:01:05,483
So they can provide useful
information when you need it

24
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:07,703
and help you reach
your fitness goals.

25
00:01:07,703 --> 00:01:10,313
And as the device that
you always have with you,

26
00:01:10,313 --> 00:01:12,883
your watch will also
provide intelligent answers

27
00:01:12,883 --> 00:01:16,323
to spoken questions and
as Dave showed us earlier,

28
00:01:16,323 --> 00:01:20,773
act as your key in a
multi-screen world.

29
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:23,953
Across the world, people
check their Android phones

30
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:29,228
an average of 125
times every day.

31
00:01:29,228 --> 00:01:31,603
And that's why we've designed
Androidwear to quickly show

32
00:01:31,603 --> 00:01:33,903
you relevant information
and make sure

33
00:01:33,903 --> 00:01:35,932
you never miss an
important message,

34
00:01:35,932 --> 00:01:37,848
while letting you stay
engaged with the people

35
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,983
that you're actually with.

36
00:01:39,983 --> 00:01:43,253
We do this by working to
understand the context of what

37
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:45,513
you care about,
while enabling very

38
00:01:45,513 --> 00:01:48,583
brief interactions
with the device.

39
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:52,193
Here's a live demo
on the LGG watch.

40
00:01:52,193 --> 00:01:54,953
You can see that it has
an Always On display,

41
00:01:54,953 --> 00:01:58,543
than at any given time, it shows
you the most important thing we

42
00:01:58,543 --> 00:02:00,633
for you.

43
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:02,373
So Jeff, it looks
like your flight

44
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:05,143
to Brazil for the
World Cup is on time.

45
00:02:05,143 --> 00:02:08,342
I guess you do deserve a
break after this big demo.

46
00:02:08,343 --> 00:02:10,013
And if Jeff wanted
to see more, he

47
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:12,623
can simply raise his
watch of tap the screen

48
00:02:12,623 --> 00:02:14,143
to switch into
vibrant, full color

49
00:02:14,143 --> 00:02:16,253
that you're already seeing here.

50
00:02:16,253 --> 00:02:19,223
Throughout the day, if Jeff
receives a notification which

51
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:22,733
buzzes his phone, his watch
will vibrate on his wrist

52
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:24,573
and show him what's
up at a glance.

53
00:02:24,573 --> 00:02:28,443
So he won't miss an important
message like this one.

54
00:02:28,443 --> 00:02:30,353
Swiping up and
down navigates you

55
00:02:30,353 --> 00:02:33,423
through this stream of cards,
which includes information

56
00:02:33,423 --> 00:02:36,703
from Google Now, apps
running on Jeff's phone,

57
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:40,552
and apps running directly
on the wearable itself.

58
00:02:40,553 --> 00:02:42,633
And when there's
a page indicator,

59
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:46,283
Jeff can swipe horizontally
to see more details.

60
00:02:46,283 --> 00:02:48,973
You can see that we've
applied material design here.

61
00:02:48,973 --> 00:02:52,763
The cards float above
beautiful, textured backgrounds.

62
00:02:52,763 --> 00:02:57,060
And just like in your
phone's notification shade,

63
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,393
you can swipe a card away to
remove it from your stream.

64
00:02:59,393 --> 00:03:01,833
Let's take a look
at Jeff's phone.

65
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,843
And that notification
has disappeared.

66
00:03:04,843 --> 00:03:08,153
Back at the watch face,
pressing and holding

67
00:03:08,153 --> 00:03:09,543
lets you choose a different one.

68
00:03:09,543 --> 00:03:13,403


69
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:15,513
You can see that there's
a broad selection

70
00:03:15,513 --> 00:03:18,993
of analog and digital designs
in a variety of styles

71
00:03:18,993 --> 00:03:21,552
to suit your tastes.

72
00:03:21,553 --> 00:03:25,313
OK, now that we're acquainted
with the overall UI model,

73
00:03:25,313 --> 00:03:28,473
let's see how Androidwear
can work for you.

74
00:03:28,473 --> 00:03:30,913
Imagine that Jeff has just
got up in the morning.

75
00:03:30,913 --> 00:03:34,782
He swipes up and sees the
weather forecast for the day.

76
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:37,723
His commute's not
looking too bad.

77
00:03:37,723 --> 00:03:40,373
And oh look, Jeff, I guess you
need that package for your trip

78
00:03:40,373 --> 00:03:41,493
to Brazil.

79
00:03:41,493 --> 00:03:43,263
You better not
forget to pick it up.

80
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:44,882
JEFF: OK, Google.

81
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:47,875
Remind me to check my
mailbox when I get home.

82
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,833
DAVID SINGLETON: Now If
we can see Jeff's phone

83
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,822
at the same time, you'll
see that this is immediately

84
00:03:52,823 --> 00:03:53,893
synced across.

85
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:58,693
[APPLAUSE]

86
00:03:58,693 --> 00:04:00,383
DAVID SINGLETON:
And in this case,

87
00:04:00,383 --> 00:04:04,303
his watch was smart enough
to know where home is.

88
00:04:04,303 --> 00:04:07,653
A little later on, as Jeff
is arriving at the office,

89
00:04:07,653 --> 00:04:09,813
his watch vibrates again
with a chat message

90
00:04:09,813 --> 00:04:11,723
from one of the team.

91
00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:14,784
He can see who it's from
and what he's saying, all

92
00:04:14,784 --> 00:04:17,032
without having to fumble
around and get out his phone.

93
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:19,563


94
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:22,302
You're watching your
phone stay in sync.

95
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,873
When you swipe away a
notification on the watch,

96
00:04:24,873 --> 00:04:27,583
it disappears from the phone,
as Jeff is showing now.

97
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,415


98
00:04:30,415 --> 00:04:34,190
[APPLAUSE]

99
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,953
It's super convenient.

100
00:04:36,953 --> 00:04:39,003
In the evening, Jeff
is having dinner

101
00:04:39,003 --> 00:04:40,855
with a friend at a restaurant.

102
00:04:40,855 --> 00:04:43,313
If he's unfamiliar with one of
the ingredients on the menu,

103
00:04:43,313 --> 00:04:45,353
he can just say--

104
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:46,353
JEFF: What is limburger?

105
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:49,192


106
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:50,983
DAVID SINGLETON: So it
looks like limburger

107
00:04:50,983 --> 00:04:52,763
or is a type of cheese.

108
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:54,692
Jeff is lactose
intolerant, so he better

109
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:58,453
order something different, or
this dinner could go wrong.

110
00:04:58,453 --> 00:05:02,003
And when Jeff receives a phone
call, his watch will vibrate,

111
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:04,843
and he can see who's
calling at a glance.

112
00:05:04,843 --> 00:05:06,963
It's another one of
Jeff's co-workers.

113
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:10,993
Now Jeff could get out his phone
to answer, but since he's busy,

114
00:05:10,993 --> 00:05:14,023
he can either swipe to reject
the call from his wrist

115
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:17,873
or swipe up to choose from one
of these quick SMS replies.

116
00:05:17,873 --> 00:05:21,537
His phone sends the
SMS, and he's done.

117
00:05:21,537 --> 00:05:27,393
[APPLAUSE]

118
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,753
Sometimes you're enjoying
dinner so much that you

119
00:05:29,753 --> 00:05:31,853
want to avoid any
more interruptions.

120
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:34,193
And for that, you can
set Do Not Disturb

121
00:05:34,193 --> 00:05:38,077
with a single downward swipe
from the top of the screen.

122
00:05:38,077 --> 00:05:40,893
[APPLAUSE]

123
00:05:40,893 --> 00:05:45,213
And now Jeff's watch won't buzz
again until he wants it to.

124
00:05:45,213 --> 00:05:48,615
Later that night,
Jeff arrives home.

125
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:49,323
Oh, that's right.

126
00:05:49,323 --> 00:05:50,643
Your package is here.

127
00:05:50,643 --> 00:05:52,532
Now that he's at
home, the reminder

128
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:56,063
that Jeff created this
morning has triggered.

129
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:57,763
You can also use
Androidwearables

130
00:05:57,763 --> 00:06:00,302
to control other
devices around you.

131
00:06:00,303 --> 00:06:02,917
Let's loosen up
with a bit of music.

132
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:03,833
JEFF: Play some music.

133
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:07,195


134
00:06:07,195 --> 00:06:08,903
DAVID SINGLETON: Now
you'll see that Jeff

135
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:10,603
has music controls on his watch.

136
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:11,513
[MUSIC - CHROMEO, "JEALOUS (I
 AIN'T WITH IT)"]

137
00:06:11,513 --> 00:06:13,293
He can see what song is playing.

138
00:06:13,293 --> 00:06:16,893
He can pause the music or
skip to the next track.

139
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:18,822
And while it's
playing, the album art

140
00:06:18,823 --> 00:06:21,333
is beautifully displayed
right there on his wrist.

141
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,913


142
00:06:23,913 --> 00:06:28,793
Finally, at the end of the
day, it's time for bed.

143
00:06:28,793 --> 00:06:30,133
JEFF: Set an alarm for 7:00 AM.

144
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:33,930


145
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,513
DAVID SINGLETON: With glanceable
notifications and quick voice

146
00:06:36,513 --> 00:06:38,563
actions, Androidwear
gives you what

147
00:06:38,563 --> 00:06:40,913
you need right when you need it.

148
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:44,032
Let's take a closer look at some
of the contextual information

149
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:46,863
that Androidwear provides
when you're traveling.

150
00:06:46,863 --> 00:06:50,473
So Jeff's about to leave on
that big trip to the World Cup.

151
00:06:50,473 --> 00:06:52,013
It's the morning of his flight.

152
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:54,793
So his phone is already
displaying relevant information

153
00:06:54,793 --> 00:06:56,483
for his trip.

154
00:06:56,483 --> 00:07:01,793
He can see his flight status
and even show his boarding pass.

155
00:07:01,793 --> 00:07:04,373
His hotel address will be
there when he needs it.

156
00:07:04,373 --> 00:07:07,413
And he knows whether or not
he'll need to pack an umbrella.

157
00:07:07,413 --> 00:07:11,003
It does look like it's going
to rain in Brazil on Friday.

158
00:07:11,003 --> 00:07:14,193
Once he's in Brazil,
Androidwear continues

159
00:07:14,193 --> 00:07:16,523
to give him useful,
timely information

160
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:19,533
at a glance, whether
it's his restaurant

161
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:22,133
reservation, the
time back at home

162
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,273
so he knows when
to call as family,

163
00:07:24,273 --> 00:07:26,713
or the local bus schedule.

164
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,043
And while he's walking
around the city,

165
00:07:29,043 --> 00:07:31,743
Jeff can see how many
steps he's taken today,

166
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:35,132
along with a step count
history for the week.

167
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:37,583
On devices that
support it, he can even

168
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,229
check his heart
rate after a jog.

169
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:43,561
[APPLAUSE]

170
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:46,423


171
00:07:46,423 --> 00:07:47,983
So we've shown you
what Androidwear

172
00:07:47,983 --> 00:07:49,713
can do out of the box.

173
00:07:49,713 --> 00:07:52,713
We're even more excited
to see what developers

174
00:07:52,713 --> 00:07:55,453
build on top of this platform.

175
00:07:55,453 --> 00:07:58,342
The Androidwear SDK
enables you to build

176
00:07:58,343 --> 00:08:02,445
glanceable, contextual apps for
this new category of device.

177
00:08:02,445 --> 00:08:03,903
Let's talk through
the capabilities

178
00:08:03,903 --> 00:08:05,363
it gives to developers.

179
00:08:05,363 --> 00:08:07,933
And then we'll
show some examples.

180
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:11,003
Right off the bat, Androidwear
automatically bridges

181
00:08:11,003 --> 00:08:12,673
notifications from
your Android phone

182
00:08:12,673 --> 00:08:15,663
or tablet directly
to your watch.

183
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:18,693
Now, Android's
notification APIs already

184
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:21,853
allow you to build
beautiful user interfaces

185
00:08:21,853 --> 00:08:25,183
with big pictures,
actions, and more.

186
00:08:25,183 --> 00:08:26,693
And there are
hundreds of thousands

187
00:08:26,693 --> 00:08:31,073
of apps delivering billions of
these notifications every day.

188
00:08:31,073 --> 00:08:35,163
And now, they're
available on your wrist.

189
00:08:35,163 --> 00:08:38,993
Back in March, we released a
developer preview, enabling

190
00:08:38,993 --> 00:08:42,813
apps running on the phone to
add things like voice replies,

191
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:46,843
have several pages, and group
notifications in bundles.

192
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:48,963
With these additions,
you can begin

193
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:52,183
to provide a tailored
experience for wearables.

194
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:54,763
And we've used these
features to add wear support

195
00:08:54,763 --> 00:08:58,192
to Google apps, like
Hangouts and Gmail.

196
00:08:58,193 --> 00:09:01,933
And there's been a huge
response from developers.

197
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:06,263
The very best wearable apps
respond to the user's context,

198
00:09:06,263 --> 00:09:08,493
put glancable cards
in the stream,

199
00:09:08,493 --> 00:09:10,813
and allow the user
to take direct action

200
00:09:10,813 --> 00:09:12,663
in just a few seconds.

201
00:09:12,663 --> 00:09:15,723
Here's one of my
favorite examples.

202
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:19,563
With Pinterest, you can
follow other people's pins.

203
00:09:19,563 --> 00:09:22,703
Pinterest app will let you know
when you're near a place that's

204
00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:25,313
being pinned by
someone you follow.

205
00:09:25,313 --> 00:09:28,477
So Jeff's friend Susie
loves Korean barbecue.

206
00:09:28,477 --> 00:09:29,893
And she's somewhat
of an authority

207
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:32,532
on the best restaurants
in San Francisco.

208
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:35,123
So when Jeff is in
the city, Pinterest

209
00:09:35,123 --> 00:09:37,273
can notify him
that he's near one

210
00:09:37,273 --> 00:09:39,613
of Susie's pinned restaurants.

211
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:42,283
The notification will appear
on his wrist just like this.

212
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:45,203
And it uses pages, allowing
him to quickly glance

213
00:09:45,203 --> 00:09:47,963
at the details, then
swipe to see a map.

214
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,853
And if he like it, he can
start navigation right

215
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:53,623
from his wrist.

216
00:09:53,623 --> 00:09:55,612
This is using Google
Maps for mobile,

217
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:58,723
which gives you turn by turn
directions on your watch.

218
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,253
It's particularly useful
when you're walking.

219
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:05,263
And it works with all
Android Wear devices.

220
00:10:05,263 --> 00:10:08,002
In addition to what's possible
with notifications bridged

221
00:10:08,003 --> 00:10:11,773
from the phone, today we're
making a full Android Wear

222
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:14,453
SDK available which
enables you to write

223
00:10:14,453 --> 00:10:23,643
code-- It's pretty great.

224
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:25,913
It enables you to write
code that runs directly

225
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:27,733
on the wearable itself.

226
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:30,953
And almost all the API's
that you're already

227
00:10:30,953 --> 00:10:33,322
familiar with on Android
are available here.

228
00:10:33,323 --> 00:10:37,663


229
00:10:37,663 --> 00:10:40,743
That means that you can
present fully customized UI,

230
00:10:40,743 --> 00:10:44,052
read sensors directly,
and much, much more.

231
00:10:44,053 --> 00:10:46,923
We're also introducing a new
set of API's and Google Play

232
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:49,323
services that makes
it easy for your app

233
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:53,183
to send data between a phone
or tablet and a wearable.

234
00:10:53,183 --> 00:10:55,933
And we've road tested these
API's with some developers

235
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:57,862
over the past few weeks.

236
00:10:57,863 --> 00:11:01,833
Let's take a look at
examples of what they built.

237
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:06,988
Eat 24 is an app that makes
food ordering both fun and easy.

238
00:11:06,988 --> 00:11:07,903
Now watch this.

239
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:11,473
Hopefully I'm going to
order a pizza in 20 seconds.

240
00:11:11,473 --> 00:11:14,973
When it comes to take out,
I'm a creature of habit.

241
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:17,493
And Eat 24 has
recognized this and takes

242
00:11:17,493 --> 00:11:19,993
advantage of that
contextual stream.

243
00:11:19,993 --> 00:11:22,763
Around the same time I
made an order last week

244
00:11:22,763 --> 00:11:26,413
it puts a notification
suggesting I order again.

245
00:11:26,413 --> 00:11:28,933
I can tap on the
notification and launch

246
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:31,753
into their full screen UI.

247
00:11:31,753 --> 00:11:34,853
And here I'm presented with
a beautiful interface that

248
00:11:34,853 --> 00:11:37,613
lets me confirm the kind
of food I'd like today,

249
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,053
let's stick with pizza.

250
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:43,493
And then I can quickly swipe to
see and repeat my last order.

251
00:11:43,493 --> 00:11:48,433
Just one more tap to pay,
and the pizza's on its way.

252
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:56,503


253
00:11:56,503 --> 00:11:59,623
I think that clocked
in under 20 seconds.

254
00:11:59,623 --> 00:12:03,273
Now you might be wondering
how this got to my watch.

255
00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:06,953
Well all I had to do was
install the Eat 24 app

256
00:12:06,953 --> 00:12:09,632
from the Play store on my phone.

257
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:12,753
When a watch is connected, the
wearable portion of the app

258
00:12:12,753 --> 00:12:16,953
is automatically installed and
kept up to date on that watch.

259
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:23,993


260
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,862
I mentioned the
new wearable API's

261
00:12:25,863 --> 00:12:29,573
for easy communication
between phone and watch.

262
00:12:29,573 --> 00:12:32,763
All the Cooks is a social
recipes app which has made

263
00:12:32,763 --> 00:12:35,393
really great use of these API's.

264
00:12:35,393 --> 00:12:37,572
I don't know about you,
but I find it really hard

265
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:39,185
to follow recipes,
especially when

266
00:12:39,185 --> 00:12:41,143
it gets to those tricky
bits where everything's

267
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:42,621
happening at the same time.

268
00:12:42,622 --> 00:12:44,663
So wouldn't it be more
convenient if I could just

269
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,513
look down at my watch
and see what to do next?

270
00:12:47,513 --> 00:12:51,089
With the All the Cooks
app I can choose a recipe.

271
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:56,212
Let's go into my favorites and
choose this beef brisket chili.

272
00:12:56,213 --> 00:12:58,513
The recipe will immediately
appear on my watch.

273
00:12:58,513 --> 00:13:00,583
So it's always
right there with me.

274
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,413
Let's get started.

275
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:04,203


276
00:13:04,203 --> 00:13:06,123
I've got all the
ingredients, so let's start

277
00:13:06,123 --> 00:13:07,043
following the steps.

278
00:13:07,043 --> 00:13:09,063
Now watch the phone carefully.

279
00:13:09,063 --> 00:13:12,613
As I move from step to step,
the phone stays in sync too.

280
00:13:12,613 --> 00:13:19,210


281
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,793
And if you're wondering
whether or not

282
00:13:20,793 --> 00:13:23,073
it's safe to wear your
watch while cooking,

283
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:25,063
it's great to know that
all the devices we're

284
00:13:25,063 --> 00:13:26,953
talking about today
are water resistant.

285
00:13:26,953 --> 00:13:32,842


286
00:13:32,843 --> 00:13:35,943
And with All the Cooks, whenever
a recipe calls for a timer,

287
00:13:35,943 --> 00:13:37,863
like this four
hours in the oven,

288
00:13:37,863 --> 00:13:39,943
I can do that right
away on my wrist.

289
00:13:39,943 --> 00:13:44,593


290
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:47,433
So no more burnt dinner.

291
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:51,032
We saw some great examples of
voice actions earlier today.

292
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:52,713
And we believe
voice actions will

293
00:13:52,713 --> 00:13:54,593
be most useful when
they can invoke

294
00:13:54,593 --> 00:13:57,203
the best service in any app.

295
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,902
We're just getting
started with this,

296
00:13:58,903 --> 00:14:01,293
but we're making voice
available for some key actions

297
00:14:01,293 --> 00:14:04,183
on the wearable today
and we'll be adding more

298
00:14:04,183 --> 00:14:06,612
over the coming months.

299
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:09,173
Lift is a transportation
service and ride sharing

300
00:14:09,173 --> 00:14:11,823
app that allows you
to request a car

301
00:14:11,823 --> 00:14:14,763
to pick you up at
your exact location.

302
00:14:14,763 --> 00:14:17,743
Lift have implemented
our call a car intent.

303
00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:22,232
So it's really easy to just walk
outside and say, "OK, Google,

304
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:27,573
call me a car."

305
00:14:27,573 --> 00:14:30,233
You'll see that Lift is able to
determine Jeff's exact location

306
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:32,683
from his phone an
presents this confirmation

307
00:14:32,683 --> 00:14:35,213
screen so he can
verify his address.

308
00:14:35,213 --> 00:14:38,593
The app is also made great use
of notifications in the stream.

309
00:14:38,593 --> 00:14:40,743
You can see when
your car has arrived,

310
00:14:40,743 --> 00:14:43,413
keep up to date throughout
the journey, and even rate

311
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:44,833
your driver right
from your wrist

312
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,205
when you're at your destination.

313
00:14:47,205 --> 00:14:48,413
Thanks to all our developers.

314
00:14:48,413 --> 00:14:57,123


315
00:14:57,123 --> 00:14:59,293
Now, we showed a
preview of a couple of

316
00:14:59,293 --> 00:15:03,243
watched we were working on with
our partners back in March.

317
00:15:03,243 --> 00:15:07,543
The LGG watch will
be available to order

318
00:15:07,543 --> 00:15:09,383
later today on the Play store.

319
00:15:09,383 --> 00:15:15,573


320
00:15:15,573 --> 00:15:17,153
In addition, you
might have caught

321
00:15:17,153 --> 00:15:19,983
a glimpse of a new
device during the demos.

322
00:15:19,983 --> 00:15:23,443
We're very happy that Samsung
is joining the Android wear

323
00:15:23,443 --> 00:15:26,113
family with the
Samsung Gear Live.

324
00:15:26,113 --> 00:15:31,623


325
00:15:31,623 --> 00:15:33,443
And the Samsung
Gear Live is also

326
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:35,028
available to order later today.

327
00:15:35,028 --> 00:15:41,263


328
00:15:41,263 --> 00:15:45,583
The Moto 360 is the first watch
to adopt the round Android Wear

329
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,453
UI.

330
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:50,963
And it will be available
for sale later this summer.

331
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:53,483
Those are just the
first three watches.

332
00:15:53,483 --> 00:15:55,793
There are many more
on the way, and we're

333
00:15:55,793 --> 00:15:59,193
thrilled to enable
developers across the world

334
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:01,333
to build apps for
what we believe

335
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,603
will be a revolutionary
new form factor.

336
00:16:04,603 --> 00:16:07,552
And now, I'd like to invite
Patrick Brady on stage

337
00:16:07,553 --> 00:16:12,263
to tell you about how we're
bringing Android to the car.

338
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,052
