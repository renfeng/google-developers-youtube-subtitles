Thanks, Dan. As mentioned earlier, we'll be using Android Studio throughout this

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,201
course. It's an IntelliJ -based IDE that is optimized specifically for

3
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:11,770
Android development. It's still in beta development, so

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,530
your version may look slightly different, but that's okay.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,000
The core functionality should still be the same. If you haven't installed it

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,870
yet, take a moment to do that now using the detailed instructions provided in

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,110
the link below. You'll also need to install the support library and that's also

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:31,110
included in the instructions. Note that the SDK is included automatically, so

9
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,000
you don't need to install that separately. If you're having difficulties, no

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,960
worries at all. We totally understand because it can be tricky to get everything

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,600
set up properly. You can search online for people who have a similar issue or

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,470
there's a troubleshooting link included below. If you still need help, you can

13
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,990
ask a question in our discussion forum as well. Once you install it, open it and

14
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,660
you can check for updates before proceeding. Check this box when you're done.
