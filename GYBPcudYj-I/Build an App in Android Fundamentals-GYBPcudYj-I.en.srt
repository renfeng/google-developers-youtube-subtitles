00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,770
In the course, we're going to build a weather app called Sunshine. The main

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,800
screen is a list of this week's forecast, with an emphasized presentation for

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,870
today's weather. With just a quick glance, I can decide if,

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:20,560
today is a stay inside, in code day. Or if I should code from the park,

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,256
instead. We have icons to indicate conditions, like snow,

6
00:00:26,256 --> 00:00:30,790
rain, fog or sunshine. We can scroll through the list,

7
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,730
to see a long range forecast. With a click on one of the forecasts,

8
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,900
will bring up a detailed view containing the rest of the weathery goodness,

9
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,390
which also gives us the ability to share the weather with our friends.

10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,940
We can go to Settings and change the unit of measure, as well as the location.

11
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,500
The app can even post system wide notifications, to let us know about weather

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,930
conditions without even entering the app. So, you might ask, why are we

13
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,120
building a weather app? We chose the weather app because it's a simple concept,

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,590
which touches most of the core APIs we want to teach and everyone can relate to

15
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,090
weather, unless you're in a bunker. By the end of the course, you'll be able

16
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,110
to use those APIs and concepts to build your own app for your final project.
