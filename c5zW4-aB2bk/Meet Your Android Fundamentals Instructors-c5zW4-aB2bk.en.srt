I'm Katherine Kwan, and I'm a developer advocate at Google. I started off by

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,000
working as an engineer on the Android apps team. I worked there for

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,740
three years on products like Google Play and Google Keep, the note taking app.

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,244
I'm continually blown away by what you can build on this platform, and

5
00:00:19,244 --> 00:00:24,590
I'm particularly inspired by those apps that can truly improve people's lives.

6
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,470
When I meet people, they often tell me about their great app ideas. But

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,420
then they feel like they don't have the technical skills to actually build it.

8
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,150
And that's why I shifted over to developer relations so

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:40,508
I can help people like you really build something great. Throughout this course,

10
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:42,868
I'll be helping you implement your very first app.

>> My name is Dan Gauthan. I've been a developer advocate at Google for

13
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,580
four years and I've worn a lot of hats here. My goal is to keep us on track to

14
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,730
make Sunshine, something that had some resemblance to a production quality app.

15
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,310
I'll introduce Android design patterns and principles. Many of which are often

16
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:08,181
missed by new Android developers. You'll learn to lean on the framework,

17
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:11,565
focusing on what makes your app unique instead of reinventing the wheel.

>> I'm Rado Mya, and I've been a developer advocate at Google for five years.

20
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,700
I started working on Androids so long ago that back then there were no devices.

21
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,940
All we had to work with were an emulator, a beater SDK, and

22
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,790
an almost fanatical devotion to the platform. I'll be joining you from here,

23
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,500
my underground Android developer bunker, and my goal isn't to get you

24
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,993
up an running as quickly as possible. It's to teach you the context behind

25
00:01:42,993 --> 00:01:47,025
the choices we'll make. And the best practices you need, to really understand

26
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:52,000
how to create great experiences specifically tailored to mobile devices. By

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,630
the time you finished this course you'll know more than just how to create yet

28
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,900
another app. You'll know how to build great apps that focus on the user.
