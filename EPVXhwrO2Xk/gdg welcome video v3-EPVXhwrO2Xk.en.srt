00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:12,268
We are super excited about DevFest 2014.

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,190
I wanna thank you all for joining us
Know that you are part of a global

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,160
diverse community people interested in
Google tech, and we hope you make at least

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,720
one new friend, today.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,150
This is the third year the GDGs have
been organizing DevFest.

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,320
And, these are great opportunities to
learn about, and play with Google

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,230
developer tools.

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,738
Last year, GDG held 160 DevFest

12
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:36,489
in 60 countries reaching more than
35,000 developers.

13
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:39,578
Google technology talks, tutorials, code
labs,

14
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:43,329
and hackathons were a big part in it.
From GDG cookies,

15
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:47,510
to dancing, to Star Wars costumes these
events are also incredibly creative and

16
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,030
fun.

17
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,430
These are just a few memories from the
many amazing events that happened all

18
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,280
over the world in 2013.

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,879
We look forward to keeping this momentum
going again this year.

20
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,218
I can't wait to see what fun this is.
