1
00:00:00,037 --> 00:00:04,190
Thanks for telling us about the
importance of proper dessert selection.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,290
So let's choose our desserts now.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,830
The earliest platform version that
our Apple support is Gingerbread.

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,860
At the current time, choosing
Gingerbread means we can cover over 99%

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,070
of the devices active
on Google Playstore.

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,690
It's also the cutoff for using Google
Play services for things like maps and

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,540
location and
the Android support library.

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,400
The support library package offers an
implementation of ui features that were

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,400
added in later releases of Android but

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,750
now can be used on older
versions of the platform.

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,040
So it's really useful.

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,825
Notice how we picked the latest
version of Gingerbread with API level

13
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:39,220
10 because it contains additional bug
fixes that API level 9 doesn't have.

14
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,320
The we can go ahead and click Next.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,340
We're going to choose the template,
Blank Activity with Fragment.

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,580
For background context and
activity serves as the present layer for

17
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,890
our UI, and a fragment represents
a behavior or portion of the screen.

18
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,995
And now we have an option to modify
the names of the files that will be

19
00:00:54,995 --> 00:00:56,770
auto-generated from the wizard.

20
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,210
The name of our activity
is MainActivity, and

21
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,720
the layout will come from activity_main,
which is an XML file.

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,730
In a similar fashion, the fragments
layout will come from fragment_main,

23
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,130
which is also an XML file.

24
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,525
I'm going to do a small change for
the name of the menu file to be called

25
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:18,220
main.xml because on a older version of
Android's tu, that was the default name.

26
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,640
Then we go ahead and hit Finish.

27
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,960
And now you should have a newly
created sunshine app with the files on

28
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,060
the left here.

29
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,540
By default, you may see
the Android view of the files,

30
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,510
which is a flattened version
of the project structure,

31
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,890
and it highlights the key Android
source files that you'll need to edit.

32
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,030
In this course, though, we're going to
be using the project view because that's

33
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,145
what we had in the older
version of Android Studio.

34
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:39,405
You can choose any view that you prefer,
though.

35
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:41,875
Make sure you wait for
the gradle build to finish.

36
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:44,895
If you have any errors, you can check
the guide and instructor notes below.

37
00:01:44,895 --> 00:01:47,125
As a tip,
you can check the build.gradle file,

38
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:49,795
which is located under the App folder.

39
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:52,235
You want to make sure that
the compileSdkVersion and

40
00:01:52,235 --> 00:01:55,975
the targetSdkVersion are both pointing
at the latest stable version of

41
00:01:55,975 --> 00:01:57,365
the platform.

42
00:01:57,365 --> 00:02:01,510
In this case, it's 21 for
the Android 5.0 Lollipop release.

43
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,720
Once it's done building, we can add a
custom app icon that's more fitting for

44
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,290
our weather app.

45
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,310
Right-click on the App folder and
click New Image Asset.

46
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,680
You can choose from any of
the clip art options or

47
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,980
you can use the one that we
provide in the download below.

48
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,540
Then, use a placeholder icon we
provide in a download below.

49
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,010
Now this will show up in
the All Apps screen, so

50
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,790
that clicking on this app
icon will launch our app.

51
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,280
It will also show up in the overview
space if sunshine is one of

52
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,950
your most recent tasks.

53
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,380
The other place you might see this app
icon is in the action bar of our app.

54
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,420
In certain videos of this course that
were filmed earlier on Kit Kat by

55
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,560
default the action bar
shows the app icon.

56
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,570
With material design on Lollipop and
later, the app icon doesn't show up

57
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,500
by default anymore, so
don't worry if you don't see it.

58
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,230
It's fine, and

59
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,330
we're going to be styling the action
bar later in lesson five, anyways.
